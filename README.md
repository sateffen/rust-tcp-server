# Rust TCP Server #

This project is just a little test project, because I wanted to play a little with Rust
and a simple server is the best thing to build.

I used [mio](https://github.com/carllerche/mio) for the eventloop and tried to implement
simething similar to the examples I found. I've got some problems with the examples,
because the API has changed in the time between and I had to rewrite some parts, but this
helped me to understand the basics.

The code is documented as far as I understood, but some passages are not described. I think
I'll write a little summary the in some days, but dunno.

If you read through the code, and see something wrong, or got a good explaination for the parts
I didn't unterstand (The comments spot the parts) you can leave an [issue](https://github.com/sateffen/rust-tcp-server/issues)
to explain.
